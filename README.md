Never manually delete branches again. Is cleaning up branches after pull requests are merged or closed a completely neglected task? This skill automatically deletes branches for you once a pull request is merged or closed.

-   Automatic branch deletion, no manual steps
-   Works across as many repositories as you want
-   Track pull request branch status in your chat channel of choice
-   Skip branch deletion when needed, simply remove the label from the pull request
-   Your choice of deletion policy â€” merge or close and merge

# Branches deleted, automatically, every time.
